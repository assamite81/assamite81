I'm from Poland. I'm a developing Manual Tester with ambitions (I would ultimately like to deal with test automation). I am a relatively new Tester, but I fell in love with this job and I want to develop in it. When I stop looking for bugs I spoil my already spoiled dog, play on my console/consoles (PlayStation/Switch) or watch movies and series.

# Experience

Over the last few months I have had the pleasure of developing my skills by working for [SalesTracker](https://salestracker24.com/).

I mainly conducted exploratory tests of new CRM system modules. Based on the tests conducted, I created test documentation and, of course, reported any errors found. After implementing the tested module, I created a module manual for both internal and customer use. I also handled the company's helpdesk. I accepted user reports, analyzed them, reproduced errors reported by employees, solved problems reported independently or forwarded reports that required developer intervention to the second line.
